        <h1>Ebony Deforestation and Conservation in Mauritius: A Story Map</h1>

        <p> This is a story map that will explore Dutch and French colonization of Mauritius, a small island in the Indian Ocean about 1,200 miles off the east coast of Africa, during the 17th and 18th centuries. It will specifically analyze the depletion of ebony forests, and the subsequent environmentalism that arose in response to this depletion. This history provides a unique and important perspective on how religion and capitalism are intertwined and informed European colonizers’ relationships to the environment. This environmental is unique and especially interesting because Mauritius had The implications of these understandings of religion, capitalism, and environmental reponsibility continue to resonate in history, politics, and culture today. 
        <p> Mauritius is perhaps best-known in popular culture because it was the habitat of the dodo bird, which went extinct by the early 18th century as a result of hunting, habitat destruction, and invasive species (species that were not native to Mauritius, and which made it impossible for the dodo to survive) that European colonizers introduced. The dodo went extinct largely because colonizers did not have any motivation to save it: they did not deem it useful for food, furs, or anything else they might be able to sell. Ebony, on the other hand, is different: colonizers valued the ebony tree for its wood, which they could sell. As a result, they had an incentive to conserve ebony, which makes the history of ebony one where conservation is more relevant than it is in the history of the dodo.
        <p> My main sources for the historical facts in the presentation are the books <i> Mauritian History: from Its Beginnings to Modern Times </i> by Vijayalakshmi Teelock and <i> Green Imperialism: Colonial Expansion, Tropical Island Edens and the Origins of Environmentalism, 1600-1860 </i> by Richard Grove. Grove's book is the main inspiration for the more conceptual historical arguments I am making. For contextual European history and definitions, I consulted the Encyclopedia Britannica, as well as some other articles and books. The primary sources (historical documents) I used are named during relevant parts of the story map. All of these sources are cited in greater depth at the bottom of this webpage. 
          
        <h2> The story map, which focuses on ebony extraction and conservation, can be found below.</h2>
          <p> Some notes about the the background map: This is a 1763 map by Jacques Nicolas Bellin, the most notable French hydrographer (scholar of bodies of waters) of the 18th century. This map was made during the "end" of my story, and was made during French colonization of Mauritius. I chose it because influence of the French on Mauritius ended up being much greater than that of the Dutch: most of the place names on the island today are French, French is still spoken there while Dutch is not, etc. This map also provides a useful opportunity for parts of the maps to function as symbols for places. Because Mauritius is so remote, there are few (if any) maps from this time period that include Mauritius on the same page as Europe or even other European colonies. Therefore, I will be using parts of this map as symbols for other places. The title of the map in the lower right-hand corner of the map, which includes the coat of arms of the King of France, represents Europe (either Holland or France, depending on the context); while the illustrated coastline view of Mauritius in the upper left-hand corner represents the Cape of Good Hope, because it is the view of Mauritius by an outsider. The zoomed-in map of Port Louis in the lower left-hand corner of the map will represent Port Louis once France takes possession of the island, while Port Louis on the unzoomed-in map while represent Port Louis during Dutch colonization, for reasons that will be explained in the presentation.
